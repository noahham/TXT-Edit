# TXT-Edit
A lightweight solution to creating text files on Mac.

Basically it lets you save a .txt file and then opens TextEdit to actually edit it. This lets you be able to still have an option to make rich text documents through TextEdit, but also be able to easily create .txt files without having to go through the settings.
